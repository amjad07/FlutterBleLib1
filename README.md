# FlutterBleLib

A library for all your Bluetooth Low Energy needs in Flutter. Internally utilises Polidea's
[MultiPlatformBleAdapter](https://github.com/Polidea/MultiPlatformBleAdapter),
which runs on [RxAndroidBle](https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle)
and [RxBluetoothKit](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit).

## BLE Simulator

This library supports [BLEmulator](https://github.com/Polidea/blemulator_flutter), the BLE simulator.
The simulation allows one to develop without physical smartphone or BLE peripheral and use one's production BLEâ€“related code in automated testing.

## Installation

To use this plugin, add `flutter_ble_lib` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).

### Android

Set `minSDKVersion` in `[project]/android/app/build.gradle` file to 18.

```gradle
defaultConfig {
  ...
  minSdkVersion 18
  ...
}
```

Support for Bluetooth Low Energy has been added in API 18, hence the library requires `minSDKVersion` to be set to 18. If BLE is not core to your application, [you can override it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27335889/how-do-i-ignore-minsdkversion-of-library-in-android-studio) and handle support detection in your code.

**Notice:** You don't need to add any permissions related to BLE to the `AndroidManifest.xml`, because they are already declared in the library's native module. However, you still need to request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission at runtime to be able to scan for peripheral. See [example's code](https://github.com/Polidea/FlutterBleLib/blob/202c6fe48300be207f80567ca4bee5b6fbc83eb5/example/lib/devices_list/devices_bloc.dart#L80) and [example's pubspec](https://github.com/Polidea/FlutterBleLib/blob/202c6fe48300be207f80567ca4bee5b6fbc83eb5/example/pubspec.yaml#L20).

### iOS

Go to `[project]/ios` directory and run `pod install`.

Add [Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsbluetoothalwaysusagedescription) key to `[project]/ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.

```xml
...
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your own description of the purpose.</string>
...
```

#### Background mode

To support background capabilities add [The `bluetooth-central` Background Execution Mode](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothBackgroundProcessingForIOSApps/PerformingTasksWhileYourAppIsInTheBackground.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013257-CH7-SW6) key to `[project]/ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.

```xml
...
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>bluetooth-central</string>
</array>
...
```

## Usage

The library is organised around a few base entities, which are:

- **BleManager**
- **Peripheral**
- **Service**
- **Characteristic**
- **Descriptor**

You have to create an instance _BleManager_ and initialise underlying native resources.
Using that instance you then obtain an instance of _Peripheral_,
which can be used to run operations on the corresponding peripheral.

All operations passing the Dart-native bridge are asynchronous,
hence all operations in the plugin return either Future or Stream.

For more informations, see [REFERENCE](https://github.com/Polidea/FlutterBleLib/blob/master/REFERENCE.md).

**Notice:** this library will not handle any permissions for you. To be able to scan for peripherals on Android you need `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` [according to Android Developer Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le#permissions).

### Initialising

```dart
BleManager bleManager = BleManager();
await bleManager.createClient(); //ready to go!
// your peripheral logic
bleManager.destroyClient(); //remember to release native resources when you're done!
```

Following snippets assume the library has been initialised.

### Handling Bluetooth adapter state

```dart
enum BluetoothState {
  UNKNOWN,
  UNSUPPORTED,
  UNAUTHORIZED,
  POWERED_ON,
  POWERED_OFF,
  RESETTING,
}


bleManager.enableRadio(); //ANDROID-ONLY turns on BT. NOTE: doesn't check permissions
bleManager.disableRadio() //ANDROID-ONLY turns off BT. NOTE: doesn't check permissions
BluetoothState currentState = await bleManager.bluetoothState();
bleManager.observeBluetoothState().listen((btState) {
  print(btState);
  //do your BT logic, open different screen, etc.
});
```

### Scanning for peripherals

```dart
bleManager.startPeripheralScan(
  uuids: [
    "F000AA00-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
  ],
).listen((scanResult) {
  //Scan one peripheral and stop scanning
  print("Scanned Peripheral ${scanResult.peripheral.name}, RSSI ${scanResult.rssi}");
  bleManager.stopPeripheralScan();
});
```

The snippet above starts peripheral scan and stops it after receiving first result.
It filters the scan results to those that advertise a service with specified UUID.

**NOTE:** `isConnectable` and `overflowServiceUuids` fields of `ScanResult` are iOS-only and remain `null` on Android.


### Connecting to saved peripheral

You can try to connect to a peripheral with known ID, be it previously scanned UUID on iOS or a MAC address on Android, and avoid the whole scanning operation in your application. To do so, you need to create an instance of `Peripheral` using:
```dart
Peripheral myPeripheral = bleManager.createUnsafePeripheral("< known id >");
```
Once you have the instance of the peripheral, you may proceed with the connection. But keep in mind 
that [Android may still not find the peripheral without scanning it first](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43476369/android-save-ble-device-to-reconnect-after-app-close/43482099#43482099).

### Connecting to peripheral

First you must obtain a _ScanResult_ from _BleManager.startPeripheralScan()_.

```dart
Peripheral peripheral = scanResult.peripheral;
peripheral.observeConnectionState(emitCurrentValue: true, completeOnDisconnect: true)
  .listen((connectionState) {
    print("Peripheral ${scanResult.peripheral.identifier} connection state is $connectionState");
  });
await peripheral.connect();
bool connected = await peripheral.isConnected();
await peripheral.disconnectOrCancelConnection();
```

The snippet above starts observing the state of the connection to the peripheral,
connects to it, checks if it's connected and then disconnects from it.

### Transactions

Methods that do not have counterpart with opposite effect and are asynchronous accept
`String transactionId` as an optional argument, to allow the user to cancel such an operation.
The Future returned to Dart will then finish with a _BleError(BleErrorCode.operationCancelled...)_,
**but this will only discard the result of the operation, the operation itself will be executed either way**.

For example, if I decided that I no longer want to run discovery on the selected peripheral:

```dart
//assuming peripheral is connected
peripheral.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics(transactionId: "discovery");
//will return operation cancelled error after calling the below
bleManager.cancelTransaction("discovery");
```

Each new operation with the same _transactionId_ will cause the previous one to be cancelled with error, if it hasn't finished yet.
If _transactionId_ is set to null or it isn't specified at all, the library sets unique integer _transactionId_ to such operation.

**NOTE:
Do not to set integers as _transactionId_ as they are used by the library.**

### Obtaining characteristics

To be able to operate on the peripheral, discovery of its services and characteristics must be run first.

```dart
//assuming peripheral is connected
await peripheral.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics();
List<Service> services = await peripheral.services(); //getting all services
List<Characteristic> characteristics1 = await peripheral.characteristics("F000AA00-0451-4000-B000-000000000000");
List<Characteristic> characteristics2 = await services.firstWhere(
  (service) => service.uuid == "F000AA00-0451-4000-B000-000000000000").characteristics();

//characteristics1 and characteristics2 have the same contents
```

Objects representing characteristics have a unique identifer, so they point to one specific characteristic,
even if there are multiple service/characteristic uuid matches.

### Manipulating characteristics

Below are 3 methods of writing to a characteristic, which all result in the same effect given
there's only one service with specified UUID and only one characteristic with specified UUID.

```dart
peripheral.writeCharacteristic(
  "F000AA00-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
  "F000AA02-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
  Uint8List.fromList([0]),
  false); //returns Characteristic to chain operations more easily

service.writeCharacteristic(
  "F000AA02-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
  Uint8List.fromList([0]),
  false); //returns Characteristic to chain operations more easily

characteristic.write(Uint8List.fromList([0]), false); //returns void
```

Monitoring or reading a characteristic from _Peripheral_/_Service_ level 
return _CharacteristicWithValue_ object, which is _Characteristic_ with additional `Uint8List value` property.
 
 ### Descriptor operations
 
List of descriptors from a single characteristic can be obtained in a similar fashion to a list of characteristics from a single service, either from Peripheral, Service or Characteristic object.
Descriptors can be read/written from Peripheral, Service or Characteristic by supplying necessary UUIDs, or from Descriptor object.

**Note:** to enable monitoring of characteristic you should use `characteristic.monitor()` or `(peripheral/service).monitorCharacteristic()` instead of changing the value of the underlying descriptor yourself.
